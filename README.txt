== Description ==
The We Are Open plugin creates a widget that displays your business hours and highlights the current day. Setup your hours once, then reuse the widget wherever you\'d like to display your hours. There is an additional setting for adding a custom message that can be used to cover the case of holidays. This plugin is no more, no less. There are no additional services to unlock or buy and there are no plans to add additional options for this plugin.

Once you have installed and activated the plugin you can set your hours through the Dashboard. Dashboard->Settings->We Are Open.

Once in the We Are Open settings area you can:

Enter your business hours in 24hour format. For example 3:00PM becomes 15.

Add an additional \'.5\' to the hour if your open or closing times ends on the half hour. For example: 4:30PM becomes 16.5.

If you would like to display a message (maybe regarding holiday hours) you can do so by checking the box marked \'Include a message about holiday hours\' and fill in your message in the text box below.

Press \'submit\' to save your changes.

--- After Setup ---

Once the setup is complete head to the Widget area. Dashboard->Appearance->Widgets  OR Dashboard->Appearance->Customize->Widgets.

A new widget has been added to your available widget list called \"We Are Open\". Add the \"We Are Open\" widget to your desired widget area.
